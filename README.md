# Tire Pressure Management System

A Go library to read the tire pressures and temperatures from the [ZEEPIN TPMS Sensor Bluetooth Low Energy Tire Pressure Monitoring System](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JXMM2P/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

## installation

	go get github.com/ricallinson/tpms

## Usage

The API is simply creating an instance of Tpms, start monitoring and read the values. The values are checked every second but it depends on the sensors being active. In testing it took 10 minutes to retrieve all four sets of data when there were no pressure changes.

	package main

	import(
		"fmt"
		"github.com/ricallinson/tpms"
	)

	func main() {
		tires, err := tpms.NewTpms()
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			return
		}
		tires.StartMonitoring()
		defer tires.StopMonitoring()
		for tires.Read()[0] == nil {}
		sensors := tires.Read()
		fmt.Printf("%d kPa, Â°C %d\n", sensors[0].Kilopascal, sensors[0].Celsius)
	}

There is an option for logging the raw data from the sensors. This will keep logging until `.StopMonitoring()` is called or the process is exited.

	tires, _ := tpms.NewTpms()
	tires.Log("/path/to/file")

## Example

I've included a basic example of use. The following commands will compile the executable and run for 10 seconds.

	cd ./examples/tmpssh
	go build
	./tmpssh -duration 10s

Once compiled you can run it indefinitely by excluding the `-duration` argument.

	./tmpssh

Alternatively you can provide any number of seconds, minutes or hours for a monitoring duration.

	./tmpssh -duration 30s
	./tmpssh -duration 20m
	./tmpssh -duration 24h

In all cases a log file will be written to `./log` containing the raw sensor data as a byte stream.
